This website no longer exists, but in the Internet Museum, you can still find information from 2001 (the picture cannot be opened). It can be seen that the Chinese name at that time was "Student Global Village".

The membership system is implemented, which means that students from all over the world will treat this website as their own home and village. In any case, this concept, even if measured by the history of the Internet Museum in 2001, is 3 years earlier than Facebook, and what I emphasize is the concept of a global village, which is similar to the current community with a shared future for mankind.

There is no doubt that this concept is too far ahead. The student global village is just a concept, not even a business model. Naturally, like all early Internet explorers, they died on the beach.

I review these histories today, mainly to let everyone know and understand, my personal super forward-looking. Because the EOS take-off plan that I will describe to you next is undoubtedly hard to recognize at this stage. Is it really in line with future trends and in line with the trend of the times? Learning the new by reviewing the past, through these past entrepreneurial stories, I believe that everyone can have a general judgment on my foresight and Insight.

As a serial entrepreneur, after entering the Internet field, he has explored and innovated all the way, with too many stories. Let's choose a few facts based on pictures to give you a testimony.

## Created a new model of distributed entrepreneurship

In the early 1990s, the concept of overseas SOHO (small office, home office) began to be introduced into China. In 2000, Beijing's famous Jianwai SOHO came out. However, as early as 1998, in accordance with this new concept, I developed a new business model for distributed entrepreneurship-the Great Alliance of Freedom white-collars workers. "Freedom white-collar workers", this Chinese term is my original creation.

Now, when searching for "freedom white-collar workers" on Baidu and Google, the items and content in it are basically all our thoughts and formulations back then. for example:

Search for "free white-collar workers" on Google, you can see the above content of Sina.com. This is all written by the reporter when we interviewed us. "I am free, I think, I study, I work, I am happy, I am a freelance white-collar worker", this was our slogan at the time. Now, in the Chinese market, the familiar slogan " Sitting at home and working, making money in pajamas" is also my first initiative at that time.

We have newly defined the concept of free white-collar workers and clarified the connection and difference with overseas SOHO. The core of this is the business philosophy of the "Great Alliance".

This is the second edition of the "Free White Collar" electronic publication published by China Electronic Audiovisual Press in 2001. I am the editor-in-chief. Simultaneously created the free white-collar alliance website (www.sohounite.com), which is four years earlier than the well-known Zhubajie（www.zbj.com） and Weike（www.vikecn.com/） in China. However, from the perspective of business philosophy, the business philosophy of freelance white-collar workers has so far surpassed them.

As of today, they are only an outsourcing part-time platform, and my design at the time was meant to unite freelance white-collar workers, to create a self-organization, self-coordination, and self-management private system. This turned this free white-collar concept into a brand-new business model with a very broad extension. At that time, there was no idea of distributed, no blockchain, or self-organizing systems.

It now appears that my understanding and cognition of free white-collar workers at that time is very similar to today's Dao philosophy.

 
## Created a new model of O2O community service

This is also the same period. In 2001, the “NetPost Station” opened in Yu Garden, Xihongmen, Daxing District, Beijing. It was the first company in the world to adopt a community O2O business model. It combined online shopping service with postal agency. It allowed the postal agents at that time to make more money, and it was convenient for the residents of the community, and it really solved the problem of the last 500 meters. At that time, most families did not have access to the Internet, they could come to the post for free, and entrust the staff of the post on the website (www.16816.com) to help them publish information on renting and selling houses, selling second-hand goods, and even recruiting talents and finding jobs. , Which is the later classified information website.

This model will be outdated if it is adopted by the postal service today. But in that year, people were too conservative in their thinking, thinking that NetPost would acquire the post office if it continued to develop in this model. Finally, due to the business model of my private enterprise, the dignified China Post issued a document specifically prohibiting post offices from approving applications for cooperation with NetPost. How honored I am, how many people in China have received such high-standard treatment?

 ![](/images/17.jpg)

We explained in every possible way, trying our best to make them understand that we are doing a business that is beneficial to the country and helpful to your General Post Office. At that time, no one was willing to work at the postal agency, and it was at a loss. It only opened three days a week, which was inconvenient for the common people. Join NetPost, open business every day, and make money. Isn’t it easier to develop postal agencies? It is also beneficial to community residents, who can enjoy early Internet convenience and services for free. At that time, people couldn't access the Internet, and it was difficult to send and receive an email. All of this is free in my netpost station. A good country, a good postal service, a good agency, and a good people. There are no disadvantages. Why should we kill it and not let us innovate and explore?

The above two cases further illustrate my foresight into the future and insight into trends. Since then, I have been thinking more about how to enable more ordinary people to share and share the convenience of the Internet, and make it easier to start their own businesses on the Internet, low-cost entrepreneurship, and obtain the dividends of the Internet. In fact, even the early-stage investment promotion and franchising industries are all models to help people start their own businesses. All of this, perhaps, is the original intention and genes of today's EOS civilian entrepreneurial plan.

 

## Cooperative entrepreneurship with new models in multiple fields of the Internet

The above entrepreneurial experience is my sole proprietorship. Later, I started to cooperate with others to start a business in Beijing. There were mainly three projects. I was one of the early three original founders. At the beginning, I determined the development direction of the three companies.

 

### Chinanet-online (CNET)

The core business model is to use a classified advertising model similar to "million grids" to advertise for China's investment-inviting enterprises. In 2010, it was listed on NASDAQ in the United States.

This is the 28 business opportunity network advertising platform under CNET.

 
### QingDa Century

The core business model is a new type of O2O off-campus education model. He has received several hundred million US dollars investment from Japan's richest man Mori Akira Group and Japanese management master Kenichi Ohmae. Back then, "QingDa Study " was all the rage in cities and villages all over China.

### Changliyuan Mobile Gas Station

The core business model is to output a complete solution for mobile phone chargers. Online advertising, offline charging. The products were sold to more than 70 countries in the world, and it was the world's largest manufacturer of public mobile phone chargers at that time.

These three companies I founded in partnership have all become leaders in the industry in their respective fields. For this reason, my friends often make fun of me. You have failed in what you did, and you have succeeded in what you instructed others to do. Yes, I am not a good trader or entrepreneur. However, I am a development teacher and entrepreneurial mentor. I will point you to a promising trend in the future and a new way of wealth that can make a lot of money in the future. Should still be qualified.

Therefore, my most significant advantage is my forward-looking awareness and grasp of the future and trends. It can be said that starting from Xiaogan, to Shenzhen, to Beijing, I have not missed the direction, trend, and even the business model that I saw once.

This grasp of the nature of the development of things constitutes my cognitive judgment and value judgment of new things and the future. Even new things, as long as they violate this cognitive logic and value logic, I can criticize rationally. For example, sharing bicycles is when it is hot. What do I think:

https://www.toutiao.com/a6416121756445229313/

In three articles in a row, I pointed out unequivocally: This distorted model is very likely to evolve into a capital farce. The prophecy has unfortunately come true. You know, that is after the shared bicycle has been praised by the prime minister and has been praised by the market as one of China's new eight wonders.

It cannot be denied that my cognition and intuition have my unique realm. My forward-looking and insightfulness is beyond the reach of ordinary people.
