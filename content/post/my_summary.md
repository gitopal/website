### 1. Global pattern, global perspective.

Whether it is a student global village or a free white-collar worker, it reflects a global pattern and vision, including the earliest transfer of intellectual property rights and intellectual property protection. I have put them on the global market for consideration. For example, the investment-inviting franchise industry I created has franchisees all over the world; Changliyuan’s mobile phone gas station has entered more than 70 countries and regions; CNET, a listed company on Nasdaq in the United States; QingDa century, it is one of the few domestic companies that can attract mainstream Japanese capital.

### 2. Avoid competition, weary involution, unwilling to move other people's cheese.

From the initial transfer of intellectual property rights in my traditional industry, to the protection of intellectual property rights later, to free white-collar workers in the Internet industry, and NetPost, to Ctyptotrees of the blockchain industry, my entrepreneurial business model is basically original creation , Did not touch anyone's cheese.

Moreover, I don't like involution. When I went to Shenzhen, I wanted to continue the transfer of intellectual property rights. However, at that time, I discovered that the market had already become involute very serious, the resource that pays top academics, Good and bad people mix, so I resolutely gave up and opened up a new model of commercial publishing. After a few years of work, the involution of this industry has also begun, so I once again gave up and entered the Internet industry, and even after the Internet market is saturated, I can further enter the blockchain new economic field to explore.

### 3. People-oriented, always revolving around civilianization and popularization of entrepreneurship.

My business model has always been to teach others how to make money, not to produce goods or provide services to directly make consumers' money. Intellectual property transfer is to allow you to master a technology to make money; free white-collar workers are to create a platform for you to make money freely; NetPost is to create an O2O business model to make you make money; CtyptoTrees is to allow you to enter the field of cross-civilization new wealth Start a business to make money.

In all these models, the threshold is particularly low. It is precisely because of this that the investment promotion model I created in Xiaogan that year can quickly develop into an industry under the condition that the practitioners generally only have a middle school education level. Among them, there are hundreds of people worth more than 10 million, and there are also hundreds of people worth over 100 million. More than a dozen people, and because of this, I pay special attention to the low threshold and civilian nature of EOS.

### 4. Be good at grasping future trends and trends, and be brave to innovate.

On the basis of grasping future trends and trends, there are 5-6 kinds of global first models that I have explored. include:

- **pioneered the investment and franchise industry;**

- **pioneered the commercial publishing model;**

- **pioneered the free white-collar alliance model;**

- **Created the O2O mode of NetPost Station;**

- **Created the Changliyuan mobile gas station mode for the first time;**

- **Initiated the CtyptoTrees cross-civilization new wealth industry.**

Except for the last CtyptoTrees, which has yet to be witnessed, other industries and models have been witnessed by the times and have passed the test of the market.

Since the historical experience of the past nearly 40 years tells us that Topal’s forward-looking and predictive nature has hardly made any mistakes, then, today, his vision and design of the Metaverse's break and take-off deserve our more attention?
