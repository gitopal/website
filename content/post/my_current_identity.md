### Cryptotree investors and founders

Cryptotree, a blockchain value development game, has been launched on the TRON public chain in 2019. The purpose of this game is to allow players to create a value-building NFT in it. This NFT is defined as the world's first generation of cross-civilization new wealth, and so far, it is the only cross-civilization new wealth. At present, the entire blockchain world does not have the term or awareness of new wealth across civilizations. Everyone intuitively believes that "NFT is the new wealth of the future", but it still stays at the stage of "digitizing art and collectibles in the real world.".

This is the ranking of CryptoTree in the ranking of Dappradar's crypto collectibles category last year. For a long time, we have always ranked first.

### Chief Strategy Officer of CNET Blockchain

CNET (http://www.chinanet-online.com/) is a listed company on Nasdaq in the United States. Since its listing in 2010, the stock price has been sluggish, and very few people at home and abroad know about this company and stock. At the beginning of 2018, after I became the chief strategy officer, through the strategic deployment of blockchain and the integration of resources, CNET's stock price went out of the bottom and became today's blockchain Internet celebrity stock.

The longest flagpole was pulled up during my tenure as its chief strategy officer. The stock price soared 700% overnight, creating a miracle of blockchain concept stocks.

This is the appointment announcement of CNET disclosed on NASDAQ in 2018.

### Vice Chairman of the Blockchain Specialized Committee of China Electronics Chamber of Commerce

This is my semi-official status. Because, the China Electronics Chamber of Commerce is an agency directly under the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, and I am also one of the initiators of this blockchain expert committee.

This is the ribbon-cutting ceremony for the establishment of the Blockchain Expert Committee in 2018. The second from the left is me.

At the same time, I was also an early Bitcoin evangelist in China.

Interested friends may wish to take a look at this article published on today's headlines in 2014, it is not out of date today. If the young people at that time listened to my advice, they should still be very proud today.

From the above introduction, we can see that at present, no matter from the personal level, the cooperation level, and the society level, I am developing around the blockchain, and I am an industry insider of the blockchain.
